/// * `c`: minimize the width of the capacity belief, `max_c - min_c`.
/// * `b`: minimize the width of the buffer belief, `max_b - min_b`.
/// * `sc`: prefer any shrinkage of the capacity interval.
/// * `sb`: prefer an upper buffer bound below the global maximum.
/// * `s`: maximize delivered data over the evaluated horizon.
/// * `ld`: minimize loss exceeding `loss_tolerance_abs`.
/// * `qdel`: minimize the largest observed queue-delay estimate (beyond the
///   unavoidable one-RTT baseline).
/// * `schmul` / `schadd`: prefer `max_c <= start_max_c / 2` /
///   `max_c < global_max_c`; evidence that the high-capacity end is ruled out.
/// * `sclmul` / `scladd`: prefer `min_c >= 2 * start_min_c` /
///   `min_c >= start_min_c + 2`; evidence that the low-capacity end is ruled
///   out.
/// * `ttsc`: minimize RTTs until the capacity interval first shrinks.
/// * `ttscl`: minimize RTTs until `min_c` rises by at least two packets/RTT.
/// * `lt`: prefer a total loss increase within `loss_tolerance_abs`.
/// * `ttc`: minimize RTTs until the capacity bounds equal their final bounds
///   in the speculative horizon.
/// * `cb`: maximize `min_c + min_b`, a conservative combined lower bound.
/// * `ttcb`: minimize RTTs until that combined lower bound reaches its final
///   value.
/// * `ttscbadd`: minimize RTTs until `min_c + min_b` increases by roughly one
///   loss-tolerance unit (allowing QE numerical slack).
/// * `scb`: prefer `min_c + min_b` not decreasing from its initial value.
///
/// The `tt*` metrics use the end of the current speculative horizon as the
/// target; if it is not reached, they receive the horizon length as a penalty.
/// To create a genuinely new objective dimension, add the corresponding
/// metric to `cc_common::Metrics` and its comparison in `CCValue`.
